## Components

Components are the building blocks of a React application. They allow you to split the UI into independent, reusable pieces.

## JSX

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to XML or HTML. It is used with React to describe the UI.

## JSX Rules

JSX has specific rules and conventions that must be followed to ensure proper rendering and functionality.

## Multiple Components

Learn how to structure and manage multiple components within a React application for better organization and scalability.

## Dynamic Content

Dynamic content in React allows you to render different data based on conditions or user interactions.

## List of Data

Rendering lists of data is a common task in React. This section covers how to efficiently manage and display lists.

## Props

Props (short for properties) are a way of passing data from parent to child components in React.

## Prop Destructuring

Prop destructuring is a technique to extract properties from props in a more concise and readable way.

## Props Children

Props children allow you to pass nested elements or components as children to other components.

## Conditional Rendering

Conditional rendering in React allows you to render different UI elements based on certain conditions.

## Styles

Styling in React can be done using various methods, including CSS, inline styles, and CSS-in-JS solutions.

## Events

Handling events in React is crucial for creating interactive user interfaces. Learn how to manage events effectively.

## State

State is a built-in object that is used to contain data or information about the component. It is mutable and should be managed within the component.

## Portal

Portals provide a way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component.

## Advanced Keys

Keys are a special string attribute you need to include when creating lists of elements. This section covers advanced usage of keys in React.
